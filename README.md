> A collection of examples covering common component testing use-cases

[ct-intro]: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/introduction

## How to use these examples

Depending on your needs, you can:

- Try out [Cypress Component Testing][ct-intro] using any example by cloning this repo, `cd`ing into an example directory, installing the dependencies, and running Cypress per that example's instructions.
- Recreate an example manually by creating a new project locally and following a given example's instructions.
- Add Cypress Component Testing into an existing project by using the instructions from the example that's closest to your project and making any adjustments that are necessary.

## How examples are structured

Each folder in this repo contains an example which has, at the top of its README, instructions on how to install the example's dependencies and run [Cypress Component Testing][ct-intro], in addition to a list of steps that were used to create that example.

Each step is numbered, and shows the commands that were run, which files were added or changed, and has a clickable commit SHA that shows the exact changes that were made in that step.
